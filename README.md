## Testing

I have included a testing log within the repository.

>>> In terms of look and feel, the site is similar across all browsers. The tablet and desktop views are almost identical, while mobile devices always drop into col-12 formatting.

>>> I tested this project primarily on Firefox but also Chrome and Edge, taking advantage of the screen size options to test using iPad, Samsung Galaxy and Kindle Fire. I also tested the site on my own Huawei device.

## Deployment

>>> I used [GitHub](https://www.github.com/) as the host for this project, and [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/) to write it, using just one branch.

I deployed this project to GitHub Pages using the following method:

    Locate the desired repository in your repository list and open it;
    Navigate to the Settings heading in the repository heading;
    Locate the GitHub Pages heading at the bottom of the page;
    Click the button beneath the Source sub-heading and change this from 'None' to 'Master Branch';
    Once the page reloads, locate the GitHub Pages heading again;
    If successful, a green box will appear beneath the heading with the link to your deployed page;
    This page will only update with new content once that content has been pushed from your developer environment.

### Cloning

Assuming you already have Git [installed](https://git-scm.com/download/), anybody can clone this repository by following these steps:

    Open the command prompt/terminal on your machine;
    Type the command 'cd' followed by the directory you wish to store the repository in;
    Go to the top of the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/kiehozero/away-day/) and click the green 'Code' drop-down button;
    Copy the [link](https://github.com/kiehozero/away-day.git) provided;
    Return to the Command Prompt and type 'git clone' followed by the copied address.
