## Bugfixes
- I spent a lot of time trying to get the club crests to display in a neat way inside the drop-down menus. I piled the CSS 
rules up in an attempt to force them elements to do what I wanted, but eventually realised the power of the Element Inspector
in the browser and simply turned parameters on and off again until I found the solution that I needed. Some of the links I
have [credited](README.md) helped me realise that with CSS there rule is often 'less is more'.

## Outstanding Issues
- There is some bleed between the mobile-specific and desktop-specific jQuery scripts. Both work fine upon loading but 
once you switch between screen sizes in developer mode the hover event listener can stick in place until another icon is 
clicked. Given that most users would not sit and flick between two screen sizes while using the app, I decided to leave 
this unfixed as time was at a premium.
